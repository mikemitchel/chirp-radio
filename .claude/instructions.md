## Current Status: BETA PREPARATION

**Goal:** Ship with feature parity to current product

**Priority Tasks (All Equal Priority):**
- Apple CarPlay integration
- Apple Watch streaming controls
- Android Auto setup (may need new player component)
- CMS webhook for content updates (research needed)
- Album art accuracy (API polling issue with fallback images)
- Cached API content strategy
- Mobile-specific CMS collections for page content
- **TODO: Fix CMS API integration in Capacitor iOS builds** - Environment variables not loading properly in production builds, preventing CMS data from being fetched in the mobile app. Needs investigation into Vite env var handling with Capacitor builds.
- **TODO: Create HTML email template for MailChimp** - Design and build responsive HTML email template for CHIRP Radio's email campaigns.
- **TODO: Integrate PayPal into Store/Shop** - Add PayPal payment processing to the store checkout flow.
- **TODO: Integrate Neon for donations** - Integrate Neon CRM donation components into the donation flow.
- **TODO: Add existing analytics** - Integrate existing analytics tracking (Issue #22)
- **TODO: Set up HotJar free account** - Configure HotJar for user behavior tracking (Issue #21)
- **TODO: Create comprehensive README.md** - Document installation, setup, Capacitor usage, Storybook, linting/formatting, and technical notes (Issue #6)
- **TODO: Android APK side-load testing** - Complete Android APK testing checklist covering core functionality, lock screen, notifications, settings, background/multitasking, and Android Auto compatibility (Issue #32)
- **TODO: Test Listen Page CMS Integration** - Manually test the new CMS fields for Listen page text content:
  1. CMS Side (http://localhost:3000/admin) - Navigate to Globals ‚Üí Website Settings ‚Üí Listen Page tab and verify the 5 new text fields appear (listenPageTitle, listenCurrentPlaylistTitle, listenPreviousPlaysButtonText, listenUserCollectionTitle, listenYourCollectionButtonText)
  2. Website Side (http://localhost:5173/listen) - Verify page loads and displays default text correctly
  3. Integration Test - Change text values in CMS, refresh website, verify changes appear
  4. Fallback Test - Clear CMS values to verify fallbacks work correctly
  5. User State Test - Test with/without being logged in to see user collection section behavior

**Future Features:**
- Email notifications when Favorite DJ is about to start (15 min before) (Issue #9)
- Collection grouping - Allow users to create folders/tags and group songs in their collection (Issue #10)
- App icon chooser - Implement alternate app icons using @capacitor-community/alternate-icons (Issue #7)

## Styling Architecture

**Philosophy:** Centralized design system with minimal component-specific styles

- `src/styles/index.css` - Design system foundation (CSS custom properties, typography, colors)
- `src/styles/layout.css` - **ALL layout styles belong here**
- Component CSS files - Only component-unique styles that don't fit in design system
- Storybook components - Amazing component library with consistent styling

---

## Code Standards

### TypeScript
- Use strict TypeScript types (exact standards TBD - awaiting clarification)
- Types must be synced between Radio and CMS repos (manual sync for now)
- Both real and mocked data must match CMS schema

### React
- **Rules of Hooks** - MUST follow all React Hooks rules
  - Claude should know these and explain as needed
- Function components (implied)
- camelCase naming convention

### Code Quality
- **No unused variables** (linting enforced)
- Follow all linting rules
- Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting, type checking, linting
  - Both Radio and CMS repos use identical standards

### Temporary Workarounds
- `// eslint-disable-next-line` comments OK while figuring things out
- **MUST remove these before committing** - fix underlying code instead
- Leaving ignore comments is "kicking the can down the road" - unacceptable long-term

---

## Testing Strategy

### Test Commands
- `npm test` - Vitest unit tests
- `npm run test:ui` - Vitest UI
- `npm run test:e2e` - Playwright e2e tests
- `npm run test:e2e:ui` - Playwright UI
- `npm run test:e2e:headed` - Playwright headed mode
- `npm run test:storybook` - Build Storybook in test mode (catches provider errors)

### Test Location
- Unit tests: Throughout codebase as `.test.tsx` files
- E2E tests: `/e2e/` directory (`.spec.ts` files)

### Testing Requirements
- Check for tests periodically
- Focus on functional tests (easier, low-hanging fruit)
- Integration tests planned for future when app is more stable
- Run `npm run test:storybook` before committing Storybook-related changes to catch provider errors

### Physical Testing
- **iOS/CarPlay:** iPhone + CarPlay setup (owner has)
- **Android/Android Auto:** Borrowed device + neighbor's car for Android Auto
- **Emulators:** Xcode and Android Studio for initial testing

---

## CarPlay Integration Status

### Implementation Complete ‚úÖ
The CarPlay integration code is **fully implemented and ready**, but requires Apple's entitlement approval before testing.

**Files Configured:**
- `ios/App/App/Info.plist` - CarPlay scene configuration
- `ios/App/App/App.entitlements` - `com.apple.developer.playable-content` entitlement
- `ios/App/App/CarPlayBridge.swift` - CarPlay UI bridge (Now Playing template)
- `ios/App/App/NativeAudioPlayer.swift` - Native audio player with CarPlay support
- `ios/App/App/SceneDelegate.swift` - Plugin registration
- `src/contexts/AudioPlaybackContext.tsx` - Singleton pattern for iOS playback

**Key Features Implemented:**
- ‚úÖ Native AVPlayer with external playback enabled for CarPlay
- ‚úÖ Singleton pattern prevents multiple initializations across hot reloads
- ‚úÖ Play/pause sync between phone app and CarPlay
- ‚úÖ Now Playing metadata with album art
- ‚úÖ Lock screen controls
- ‚úÖ Background audio playback
- ‚úÖ Remote command center integration

### Waiting for Apple Approval ‚è≥

**Current Status:** Entitlement requested from Apple, awaiting approval

**What to do when approved:**

1. **Check for approval email** from Apple Developer Program
   - Subject: "CarPlay Audio App Entitlement Request - Approved"
   - Check spam folder if not in inbox

2. **Update provisioning profiles:**
   ```bash
   # In Apple Developer Portal:
   # 1. Go to Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles
   # 2. Select your App ID (com.ryanwilson.chirpradio)
   # 3. Verify "CarPlay Audio" capability is enabled
   # 4. Regenerate provisioning profiles
   # 5. Download new profiles
   ```

3. **Install new profiles in Xcode:**
   - Open Xcode preferences ‚Üí Accounts
   - Select your Apple ID
   - Click "Download Manual Profiles"
   - Or drag new .mobileprovision files to Xcode

4. **Clean and rebuild:**
   ```bash
   cd ios/App
   xcodebuild clean
   # Then rebuild in Xcode (Cmd+B)
   ```

5. **Test in CarPlay Simulator:**
   - Xcode ‚Üí Open Developer Tool ‚Üí Simulator
   - Run your app
   - I/O ‚Üí External Displays ‚Üí CarPlay
   - App should appear in CarPlay grid
   - Tap to open, should show Now Playing interface

### Troubleshooting

**If CarPlay shows "Unable to connect" after approval:**
- Verify provisioning profile includes CarPlay entitlement
- Check Xcode console for CarPlay logs (look for üöó emoji)
- Ensure Now Playing info is set (happens automatically)
- Verify audio session is active

**Common issues:**
- **No CarPlay scene connection** ‚Üí Entitlement not approved yet
- **App appears but can't connect** ‚Üí Provisioning profile needs regeneration
- **No play/pause sync** ‚Üí Remote command center not configured (should be automatic)

### Testing Checklist (After Approval)

**CarPlay Simulator:**
- [ ] App appears in CarPlay grid
- [ ] Tapping app shows Now Playing interface
- [ ] Album art displays correctly
- [ ] Track metadata shows (song, artist, album)
- [ ] Play button starts stream
- [ ] Pause button stops stream
- [ ] Play/pause syncs with phone app
- [ ] Now Playing shows "CHIRP Radio" when idle

**Real CarPlay (in vehicle):**
- [ ] App appears in CarPlay
- [ ] Audio plays through car speakers
- [ ] Play/pause works from CarPlay
- [ ] Play/pause works from steering wheel controls
- [ ] Lock screen controls work
- [ ] Switching apps doesn't stop playback
- [ ] Incoming call pauses/resumes correctly

## Storybook

### Provider Setup
All Storybook stories are wrapped with required context providers in `.storybook/preview.ts`:
- `HelmetProvider` - React Helmet for document head management
- `BrowserRouter` - React Router for navigation
- `UserProvider` - User state and authentication
- `CMSProvider` - CMS data and content
- `AuthProvider` - Authentication state
- `NotificationProvider` - Toast and modal notifications

**Important:** If you add a new context that components depend on, you MUST add it to the Storybook decorator chain in `.storybook/preview.ts`. Otherwise, stories will fail with "must be used within a Provider" errors.

### Testing Storybook
Run `npm run test:storybook` to catch provider errors before committing. This builds Storybook in test mode and will fail if any stories have build errors (missing providers, type errors, etc).

---

## Environment & Data

### Mock vs Real Data
- `sample.env` ‚Üí rename to `.env` to configure
- `VITE_USE_CMS_API=true` - Fetch from dev CMS
- `VITE_USE_CMS_API=false` (or absent) - Use mock JSON data
- `.env` is gitignored and safe for local development

### CMS Integration
- Separate repo: `chirp-cms`
- Types manually synced between repos
- Radio and CMS `main` branches are both source of truth
- Data shapes may have been modified (Lexical conventions) - needs reconciliation

### Known Issues
- **Capacitor 3 + Lexicon** requires older React version for CMS only (doesn't affect Radio app)
- **Album art polling:** `https://chirpradio.appspot.com/api/current_playlist` causes fallback image flashes

---

## Git Workflow

### Branching
- Main branch: `main`
- **New branch for each feature** (required)
- No direct commits to main

### Commits
- **Ask before committing** (don't commit automatically)
- Run tests before committing when appropriate
- Pre-commit hooks will enforce quality standards
- Follow existing commit message style (check `git log`)

### Cross-Repo Coordination
- Changes may need coordination between `chirp-radio` and `chirp-cms`
- Outline what needs to change in both repos before starting work

---

## Claude Workflow Guidelines

### Problem-Solving Approach
- **DO NOT go down rabbit holes**
- Simple solutions are better than complex ones
- When encountering errors:
  1. Propose 2-3 simple solutions with pros/cons
  2. Explain what each might break
  3. Note performance implications
  4. Let user choose approach

### Refactoring
- **Ask before architectural changes or refactoring**
- Avoid partial fixes that leave code in broken state

### Communication Style
- **DO NOT say "this is perfect" or "everything is working"**
- Claude cannot test or see the actual app
- Instead: "Ready for review - let me know if you see any errors"
- Comments: Keep as bullet points
- Explanations: Include tradeoffs and implications

### Code Changes
- Use strict TypeScript types (see standards below)
- Follow Rules of Hooks
- No unused variables
- Remove all lint-ignore comments before committing

---

## TypeScript Standards

### 1. `any` vs `unknown` Types
- **Generally avoid `any` types**
- Use `unknown` when receiving data from APIs with uncertain structure
- OK to use `any` temporarily while figuring things out
- **Before committing:** Replace `any` with actual types and verify nothing broke

### 2. Return Type Inference
- **Allow TypeScript to infer return types** when it makes sense
- No need for explicit return types on all functions
- Use explicit types when inference would be unclear

### 3. Null Checking & Type Safety
- Goal: Explicit types for everything in production code
- OK to bypass TypeScript temporarily while working things out
- **Critical:** Front-end and CMS types must stay synced
- If types diverge, create a middle layer to transform them
- Both repos should use the same types wherever possible

### 4. Type Assertions (`as Type`)
- **Use sparingly** when necessary
- Prefer type guards and proper typing over assertions

### 5. API/CMS Response Types
- **All API calls must have explicit TypeScript interfaces/types**
- Define expected response shapes before implementation
- Maintain type definitions as API evolves
- Front-end and CMS must share compatible types

### Summary
- Temporary `any`: OK during development
- Production `any`: Replace with proper types before commit
- API responses: Always typed
- Type sync: Front-end ‚Üî CMS types must match
- Testing: Check for breakage before committing type changes
