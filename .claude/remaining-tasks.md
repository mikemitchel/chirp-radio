# CHIRP Radio - Remaining Tasks

## Waiting for External Dependencies

- **Android Auto** - Code complete, tested in emulator, needs physical device testing (see PLATFORM_INTEGRATION.md)
- **iOS Production CMS** - Needs CMS deployed, then update `VITE_CMS_API_URL` in `.env.production`

## Before Beta Work

### Frontend

- iPad responsive styling and layout optimization (app now supports iPhone + iPad)
- **Neon Donations Integration** - Create new form in Neon that embeds into site or parallels CrDonation component for seamless UX
- **PayPal Store Integration** - Set up PayPal for store (currently nothing configured in PayPal for CHIRP)
- **Song Request API Integration** - MakeRequest.tsx UI complete, needs API endpoint connection (handleSubmit currently just logs to console)
- **Mobile CMS Integration** - Migrate remaining pages to use CMS content:
  - AccountSettings.tsx - No mobile CMS integration (still hardcoded)
  - NowPlaying.tsx - Minimal page with hardcoded header, no CMS integration
  - First Launch Welcome screen - Not implemented
  - Terms Acceptance flow - Not implemented
  - Global error message handler - Not implemented

### CMS (chirp-cms repo)

- **Recent Shows Automation** - Get the recent two shows automatically - emailed about getting dj named folders to pull from
- **Navigation Management** - Add method to manage navigation via CMS - future feature. Will need navigation refactor
