          The Site and App do not target children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly, directly
          or passively, collect information from children under the age of 13. If we create offers and
          products that make it appropriate to collect information from children under the age of 13,
          we will notify you of the change in this Policy. We also will ask a parent to confirm his/
          her consent in advance of any collection, use or disclosure of that information.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of "Cookies"</h2>
        <p>
          Cookies are small text files placed on your hard drive by a website when you visit that
          website. These files identify your computer and record your preferences and other data about
          your visit so that, when you return to the site, the site recognizes you and can personalize
          your visit. In general, we use cookies to collect information so that we can determine how
          to improve the Site by seeing which areas, features, and products are most popular, to
          personalize the Site, to make recommendations based on content you have liked in the past,
          to improve the overall site experience, and to complete transactions you have requested. In
          the event that we permit third parties to advertise on our Site, those advertisers may also
          use their own cookies. Such outside cookies are governed by the privacy policies of the
          entity placing the ads, and are not subject to this Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
          Most browsers automatically accept cookies as the default setting. You should be able to
          modify the setting of your browser to reject cookies or to prompt you before accepting a
          cookie from the websites you visit by editing your browser options. If you decide not to
          accept our cookies, you will still be able to access those parts of our Site available to
          the general public, but you may not be able to use some of the Site's features or services
          and you may have a less satisfactory experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          As technology advances and cookies provide more functionality, we expect to utilize them in
          different ways. As we do so, this Policy will be updated to provide you with more
          information. For example, by understanding how you use the Site from your computer or other
          device, we are able to customize and personalize your experience.
        </p>

        <h2>Use of Information</h2>

        <h3>Use of Personal Information</h3>
        <p>
          In general, we use personal information internally to serve you and to enhance and extend
          our relationship with our users. We use personal information for donation purposes, to
          complete transactions you have requested, to anticipate and resolve problems with our Site
          or App, to respond to support inquiries, to create and inform you of upcoming events and
          CHIRP related news, and to inform you of new products or services. Please review our third
          party processor's privacy policy to determine how your personal information is processed and
          used by such parties.
        </p>

        <h3>Use of Non-Identifiable Information</h3>
        <p>
          We may use information about you for our own internal statistical, design or operational
          purposes, such as estimating our audience size, measuring aggregate traffic patterns, and
          understanding demographic, customer interest, purchasing, and other trends among our users.
          We may outsource these tasks to third parties, provided the use and disclosure of your
          personal information by these third parties is restricted to performance of these tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Disclosure and Use of Information</h2>
        <p>
          We disclose personal information only when we have your consent to do so, as necessary to
          complete a transaction you have requested, when required by law, or when permitted to
          protect our rights or property. The following section describes these disclosure
          circumstances more fully. CHIRP does not share, sell, or trade user or donor information
          with any other entities.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Your Consent.</strong> We will disclose your personal information to third parties
          with your consent, which we may obtain in writing, verbally, through online means, or as
          part of a separate agreement. If new services are offered in the future that require
          disclosure of personal information to third parties or other uses of personal information
          not covered in this Policy, we will update this Policy to reflect the changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Transaction Processing.</strong> We may disclose personal information to third
          parties as necessary to complete a transaction you have requested. Please review the

        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Protection of CHIRP and Others:</strong> We may release personal information when we
          believe release is appropriate to comply with the law (e.g., a lawful subpoena, warrant or
          court order); to enforce or apply our policies; to initiate, render, bill, and collect for
          amounts owed to us; to protect our rights or property; to protect you from fraudulent,
          abusive, or unlawful use of our Site; or if we reasonably believe that an emergency
          involving immediate danger of death or serious physical injury to any person requires
          disclosure of communications or justifies disclosure of records without delay.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Outsourcing.</strong> We may outsource certain tasks to third parties, provided the
          use and disclosure of your personal information by these third parties is restricted to
          performance of these tasks.
        </p>

        <h2>Third-Party Sites</h2>

          may also enable third-party advertising networks, advertisers and ad servers to promote
          third-party products and/or services by placing advertisements on the CHIRP website. These
          third party sites may use their own cookies and/or web beacons in order to monitor
          information related to those links or advertisements. Clicking on such links or
          advertisements will direct you to the website of a third party.

          policy. The privacy policies of third-party website will differ from this Policy. Therefore,

          procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect online. While we have taken
          efforts to guard your personal information, we cannot guarantee that your information is
