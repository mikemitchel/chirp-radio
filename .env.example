# CHIRP Radio Frontend - Environment Variables

# ============================================
# CMS API Configuration
# ============================================

# Enable/disable CMS API (true = use API, false = use mock data)
# For production, this should be set to "true"
VITE_USE_CMS_API=true

# CMS API URL
# Development: http://localhost:3000/api
# Production: https://your-cms-domain.com/api
VITE_CMS_API_URL=http://localhost:3000/api

# ============================================
# Production Configuration Notes
# ============================================
#
# When deploying to production:
#
# 1. Set VITE_USE_CMS_API=true to enable CMS content
#
# 2. Set VITE_CMS_API_URL to your hosted CMS URL
#    Example: VITE_CMS_API_URL=https://cms.chirpradio.org/api
#
# 3. The caching system will automatically:
#    - Store content in browser localStorage
#    - Load cached content instantly on page load
#    - Fetch fresh data in background when cache is stale (24hr TTL)
#    - Continue working offline with cached data if API is unavailable
#
# 4. Cache behavior:
#    - First load: Fetches from API, saves to cache
#    - Subsequent loads: Shows cached data immediately, refreshes in background
#    - API unavailable: Uses cached data (graceful degradation)
#    - Webhooks (dev only): Clears cache when content changes in CMS
#
# No additional configuration required for production caching!
